    <summary><b>More about me</b></summary>
    
I am passionate about creating interactive and engaging web experiences that are both responsive and accessible. Skilled in turning design concepts into workable solutions, I specialize in front-end development focusing on React. 

As a recent graduate with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, I possess a strong foundation in programming concepts and practical software development skills. During my Student Industrial Work Experience ( SIWES) training at Octofi Limited, I gained hands-on experience in web development, including developing a responsive website with structured data markup and optimized metadata, as well as using Git for code management to increase collaboration efficiency and reducing code conflicts.

In addition, I have created two web applications, TaskMate and ThoughtStream, using React.js, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Through these projects, I have honed my skills in front-end development, user interface design, and web optimization techniques, achieving high user satisfaction ratings and positive feedback.

Moreover, as the Chief of Staff for NACOS at Nnamdi Azikiwe University, in collaboration with the executives, I organized a successful boot camp that trained over 20 students in Back-end & Front-end Development, Block Chain, and Cloud Computing. This experience allowed me to exercise my leadership and communication skills, as well as my ability to collaborate effectively with a team.

My goals include investigating and resolving issues, as well as designing solutions that align with best practices and industry standards. I aim to build applications that are not only scalable and efficient but ones that provide a seamless user experience.

Looking to use knowledge from my coursework and experience to bring value to an organization with a well-built team and a great sense of community.

My stacks include React.js, JavaScript, CSS3, Bootstrap, Tailwind, and HTML5.
